# Smart-Garage-Door
### Smart Garage Door IoT Project.
## ğŸ’» Technologies and Tools Used:
### 
ğŸ’  Raspberry Pi
###
ğŸ’ Limit switches (Configured as an input with pull-up resistor)
###
ğŸ’ Rotary Encoder (Configured as an input with pull-up resistor)
### 
ğŸ’ Stepper motor
### 
ğŸ’ EEPROM
### 
ğŸ’ I2C protocol
### 
ğŸ’ LED
### 
ğŸ’ Buttons
## ğŸ’¡ Key Features of the Device:
###  
ğŸ’  The door can be calibrated and opened/closed using buttons.
###  
ğŸ’  The door can be stopped while opened/closed by pressing the same button again.
###  
ğŸ’  The device remembers its state even if the power goes off.
### 
ğŸ’  After powering back on, it waits for a button press and continues from where it stopped. 
### 
ğŸ’  If power is lost during calibration, open/close it indicates an error using LEDs, and then the device needs to recalibrate. 
### 
ğŸ’  If the door gets stuck, it immediately stops and indicates an error. 
## How the device works: 
The software operates in a state machine consisting of two states. Case 1 is responsible for 
calibration, and Case 2 is responsible for door open/close operations. When the device 
powers on, it checks the EEPROM states, and based on the EEPROM states, it directs the 
system to the relevant case. In each case, a stuck detection is performed, and if the door 
gets stuck it immediately stops and recalibrates the door.
